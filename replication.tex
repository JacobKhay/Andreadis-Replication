We replicate Andreadis et al. (\citeproc{ref-andreadis2025}{2025}) on
the correlation between the level and growth of artificial intelligence
employment and education, innovation, and industry factors across U.S.
counties from 2014 to 2023. We successfully reproduce their main results
and extend the analysis by employing log-population weights to assess
robustness. The core associations persist, though most magnitudes
shrink. We also highlight unsupported causal claims in Andreadis et al.
(\citeproc{ref-andreadis2025}{2025}), given its observational design.

Declaration: There are no financial conflicts of interest to share.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

This paper replicates the analysis of Andreadis et al.
(\citeproc{ref-andreadis2025}{2025}) on the correlation between the
level and growth artificial intelligence employment openings and
education, innovation, and industry factors across U.S. counties from
2014 to 2023. Understanding where AI employment emerges and how it
spreads is important for both researchers and policymakers, since the
rise of AI has the potential to reshape regional economies, alter the
demand for skills, and shift patterns of innovation. County-level
variation offers a granular perspective on how these transformations
take hold across the United States.

The outcome of interest is the share of AI-related job postings at the
county-year level. This measure captures both the absolute level of AI
employment opportunities and how those opportunities evolve over time.
Tracking these dynamics provides insight into which regions gain early
access to AI-driven growth and which lag behind.

The original study links county-level AI employment to several
explanatory factors. Education is captured by the share of adults with a
college degree, innovation by local patenting activity, and industry
factors by the composition of employment across sectors. Together, these
variables represent structural characteristics that might condition
whether a region becomes a hub for AI-related work.

Andreadis et al. (\citeproc{ref-andreadis2025}{2025}) find that AI
employment is strongly correlated with higher educational attainment,
more innovation activity, and certain industry profiles. These
associations are robust across specifications, suggesting that counties
with strong human capital, innovative capacity, and aligned industries
are more likely to attract AI jobs. The results highlight structural
divides in access to AI employment opportunities across the country.

We reproduce these results and then extend the analysis by applying
log-population weights. This alternative weighting scheme reduces the
influence of the largest counties while still reflecting the relative
size of local labor markets. Under this adjustment, the core
relationships persist but the estimated magnitudes generally shrink.
This indicates that while large counties contribute to the overall
pattern, the relationships hold across the broader distribution of
counties.

Finally, we note that some of the causal interpretations in Andreadis et
al. (\citeproc{ref-andreadis2025}{2025}) are not supported by the
observational nature of the data. While the correlations are informative
and highlight important regional patterns, they do not establish that
education, innovation, or industry factors directly cause higher AI
employment. Our replication underscores the value of the evidence while
also emphasizing the limits of what can be inferred from the design.

\section{Data}\label{data}

The study utilizes multiple data sources to construct a comprehensive
county-level dataset spanning 2014--2023:

\textbf{AI Employment Data}: Job posting data from Lightcast, which
aggregates information from over 40,000 online job boards, newspapers,
and employer websites. AI-related jobs are identified through skills and
keywords associated with AI development and use. The dependent variable
\(AI_{it}\) is defined as:

\[
AI_{it} = \frac{\text{AI job postings}_{it}}{\text{Total job postings}_{it}} \times 100 \tag{1}
\]

\textbf{Demographic Variables}: From the American Community Survey
(ACS), we include bachelor's share (percentage of workforce with
bachelor's degree or higher), black population share (percentage of
county population identifying as Black), poverty share (percentage of
population below federal poverty line), log population (natural
logarithm of county population), and log median income (natural
logarithm of median household income).

\textbf{Innovation Indicators}: We measure patents per employee (USPTO
patent counts normalized by employment), AI patents share (percentage of
patents classified as AI-related), STEM degrees share (percentage of
awarded degrees in STEM fields), and degrees per capita (total degrees
awarded per capita).

\textbf{Industry and Labor Market Variables}: These include labor market
tightness (ratio of job postings to unemployed workers), manufacturing
intensity (employment share in manufacturing sector), ICT intensity
(employment share in information and communication technology), turnover
rate (worker separation rate from Quarterly Workforce Indicators), and
large establishments share (percentage of employment in large firms).

\textbf{Housing Market}: We include house price growth from Federal
Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).

All explanatory variables are lagged by one year to address potential
endogeneity concerns. The baseline specification relates the dependent
variable to these covariates using the following model:

\[
AIShare_{ct} = \alpha + \beta_1 Education_{ct} + \beta_2 Innovation_{ct} + \beta_3 Industry_{ct} + \gamma X_{ct} + \epsilon_{ct} \tag{2}
\]

where \(AIShare_{ct}\) denotes the proportion of AI-related job postings
in county \(c\) at year \(t\), and \(X_{ct}\) includes demographic,
labor market, and housing controls.

\subsection{Reproduction of Original
Results}\label{reproduction-of-original-results}

We successfully reproduced the main findings from Tables 1 and 2 of
Andreadis et al. (\citeproc{ref-andreadis2025}{2025}). The reproduction
confirms the authors' key empirical findings regarding the correlates of
AI employment across U.S. counties. All coefficients, standard errors,
and significance levels match the original results within rounding
error, demonstrating the reproducibility of their analysis.

\section{Extension: Log-Population Weighting
Analysis}\label{extension-log-population-weighting-analysis}

To assess the robustness of the original findings, we re-estimated all
models using log-population weights instead of the original weights.
This approach reduces the disproportionate influence of very large
counties while still accounting for size differences.

The modified weighting scheme is: \(w_{it} = \log(Population_{it})\)

This transformation addresses concerns that extremely populous counties
(e.g., Los Angeles County with 10+ million residents) might drive
results that don't generalize to typical counties.

\subsection{Results}\label{results}

The comparison between equal-weighted and log-population-weighted
regressions reveals several important patterns:

\emph{Magnitude Effects}: The estimated effects of key predictors are
highly sensitive to the weighting scheme. For AI share levels (Figure
1), the coefficient on bachelor's share drops substantially when
switching to log-population weights in several specifications,
suggesting that the relationship between education and AI adoption may
be driven partly by large metropolitan areas.

\emph{Labor Market Tightness}: This emerges as the most robust predictor
across both weighting schemes and both dependent variables. In Figure 1,
labor tightness maintains strong positive effects regardless of
weighting method, and in Figure 2, it consistently predicts AI job
growth. This suggests that tight labor markets create conditions
conducive to AI adoption across counties of all sizes.

\emph{STEM Education}: STEM degree share shows consistent positive
relationships in both weighting schemes, though magnitudes vary. This
indicates that technical human capital is important for AI adoption
beyond just large metropolitan areas.

\emph{Manufacturing vs.~Technology Sectors}: Manufacturing intensity
consistently shows negative relationships with AI adoption, while ICT
intensity shows positive effects. These patterns persist across
weighting schemes, suggesting structural differences in how traditional
versus technology-oriented industries adopt AI.

\emph{County Size Effects}: The divergence between weighting schemes is
most pronounced for variables like bachelor's share and population size
itself, indicating that large counties drive many of the education--AI
relationships found in the original analysis.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

This replication and extension of Andreadis et al.~(2025) demonstrates
both the reproducibility and the limitations of their findings. The
successful reproduction confirms that local labor market conditions,
human capital, and innovation capacity are correlated with AI employment
across U.S. counties. At the same time, our analysis highlights three
qualifications to the original study's conclusions.

\emph{First}, the original study employs causal language that overstates
what the empirical design can support. Terms such as ``drivers,''
``determinants,'' and references to factors that ``significantly
predict'' AI adoption suggest causal mechanisms, even though the
fixed-effects regressions can only document conditional correlations.
Without exogenous variation or quasi-experimental identification
strategies, these patterns likely reflect some combination of causal
effects, reverse causality, and selection processes.

\emph{Second}, the alternative log-population weighting analysis shows
that several relationships are sensitive to the influence of large
metropolitan counties. Labor market tightness remains the most
consistent predictor across both weighting schemes and both dependent
variables, suggesting that tight labor markets foster conditions
conducive to AI adoption regardless of county size. By contrast,
educational attainment becomes substantially weaker once the influence
of large metros is reduced, implying that this factor may not be as
generalizable across all counties as the original analysis suggests.

\emph{Third}, the industry composition effects prove relatively stable
across weighting schemes. Manufacturing intensity consistently shows
negative associations with AI adoption, while ICT sector concentration
shows positive relationships. These results suggest that structural
economic factors may be more fundamental to the geography of
technological adoption than demographic characteristics.

\emph{Policy implications}: Taken together, these findings indicate that
the empirical regularities documented by Andreadis et al.~(2025) should
be interpreted with caution. Policies that seek to strengthen labor
markets and industry composition appear relevant across a wide range of
counties, while education-focused interventions may generate the largest
benefits in large metropolitan areas where complementary institutions
and network effects are strongest.

More broadly, this replication underscores the value of robustness
checks in regional economic research and the need for care when moving
from correlational evidence to policy recommendations. Even modest
changes in specification, such as alternative weighting schemes, can
materially shift both the interpretation and the policy relevance of
empirical results on technological change.

\section{Critical Assessment of Causal
Claims}\label{critical-assessment-of-causal-claims}

\subsection{Identification of Problematic Causal
Language}\label{identification-of-problematic-causal-language}

The original study by Andreadis et al.~(2025) often employs language
that suggests causal relationships, even though the empirical analysis
is based on observational county-level data with multiple potentially
endogenous predictors. Several passages illustrate this concern.

In the \emph{Introduction}, the authors state:\\
\textgreater{} ``Second, we identify several key drivers of AI job
intensity, including demographics, innovation, and industry factors,
after controlling for county and year fixed effects. Specifically,
higher shares of STEM degrees, labor market tightness, and patent
activity significantly predict greater AI adoption, underscoring the
importance of education, innovation, and dynamic labor markets.''

In \emph{Section III}, they conclude:\\
\textgreater{} ``Labor market tightness emerges as a key driver, with a
positive and highly significant coefficient\ldots{} highlighting the
importance of technical education and local innovation capacity in
fostering AI job growth.''

And in the \emph{Conclusion}:\\
\textgreater{} ``Counties with stronger innovation ecosystems, higher
STEM degree attainment, and tighter labor markets have seen greater AI
job growth, whereas manufacturing-heavy regions and areas with high
labor turnover have faced challenges in integrating AI. These findings
point to the role of place-based policies to attract and retain top-tier
talent for economic development.''

Each of these statements frames correlational results as causal
mechanisms. Terms such as ``drivers,'' ``emerges as a key driver,''
``underscoring the importance,'' and ``findings point to the role of
policy'' imply that altering these variables would directly change AI
adoption outcomes. Yet the empirical strategy---fixed-effects
regressions on observational county characteristics---does not support
such causal inference. The results can only be interpreted as
conditional associations, not as estimates of the effects of education,
innovation, or labor market conditions on AI employment.
