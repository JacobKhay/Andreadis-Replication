We partially replicate Andreadis et al.
(\citeproc{ref-andreadis2025}{2025}), henceforth, AKCLM, on the
correlation between the level and growth of artificial intelligence
employment, on one hand, and a collection of factors involving
education, innovation, and industry across U.S. counties from 2014 to
2023. We successfully reproduce some of their results and extend the
analysis by using log-population weights to assess robustness. The core
associations persist, though almost all magnitudes shrink. We also
critique unsupported, given its observational design, causal claims made
by AKCLM.

Declaration: There are no financial conflicts of interest to share.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

This paper replicates the analysis of Andreadis et al.
(\citeproc{ref-andreadis2025}{2025}) on the correlation between the
level and growth artificial intelligence employment openings and
education, innovation, and industry factors across U.S. counties from
2014 to 2023. Understanding where AI employment emerges and how it
spreads is important for both researchers and policymakers, since the
rise of AI has the potential to reshape regional economies
(\citeproc{ref-acemoglu2024}{Acemoglu, 2024};
\citeproc{ref-brynjolfsson2021}{Brynjolfsson, Rock, and Syverson,
2021}), alter the demand for skills
(\citeproc{ref-acemoglu2019}{Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019};
\citeproc{ref-autor2015}{Autor, 2015}), and shift patterns of innovation
(\citeproc{ref-babina2024}{Babina et al., 2024}). County-level variation
offers a granular perspective on how these transformations take hold
across the United States.

The outcome of interest is the share of AI-related job postings at the
county-year level. This measure captures both the absolute level of AI
employment opportunities and how those opportunities evolve over time.
Tracking these dynamics provides insight into which regions gain early
access to AI-driven growth and which lag behind.

The original study links county-level AI employment to several
explanatory factors. Education is captured by the share of adults with a
college degree, innovation by local patenting activity
(\citeproc{ref-giczy2022}{Giczy, Pairolero, and Toole, 2022}), and
industry factors by the composition of employment across sectors.
Together, these variables represent structural characteristics that
might condition whether a region becomes a hub for AI-related work.

AKCLM find that AI employment is strongly correlated with higher
educational attainment, more innovation activity, and certain industry
profiles. These associations are robust across specifications,
suggesting that counties with strong human capital, innovative capacity,
and aligned industries are more likely to attract AI jobs. The results
highlight structural divides in access to AI employment opportunities
across the country.

We reproduce these results and then extend the analysis by applying
log-population weights. This alternative weighting scheme reduces the
influence of the largest counties while still reflecting the relative
size of local labor markets. Under this adjustment, the core
relationships persist but the estimated magnitudes generally shrink.

Finally, we note that AKCLM's causal interpretations are not supported
by the observational nature of the their data
(\citeproc{ref-holland1986}{Holland, 1986}). While the correlations are
informative and highlight important regional patterns, they do not
establish that education, innovation, or industry factors directly cause
higher AI employment. Our replication underscores the value of the
evidence while also emphasizing the limits of what can be inferred from
the design.

\section{Data}\label{data}

The study utilizes multiple data sources to construct a comprehensive
county-level dataset spanning 2014--2023:

\textbf{AI Employment Data}: Job posting data from Lightcast
(\citeproc{ref-beckett2023}{Beckett, 2023}), which aggregates
information from over 40,000 online job boards, newspapers, and employer
websites. AI-related jobs are identified through skills and keywords
associated with AI development and use
(\citeproc{ref-acemoglu2022}{Acemoglu et al., 2022}). The dependent
variable \(AI_{it}\) is defined as:

\[
AI_{it} = \frac{\text{AI job postings}_{it}}{\text{Total job postings}_{it}} \times 100 \tag{1}
\]

\textbf{Demographic Variables}: From the American Community Survey
(\citeproc{ref-census_acs}{U.S. Census Bureau, 2024a}), we include
bachelor's share (percentage of workforce with bachelor's degree or
higher), black population share (percentage of county population
identifying as Black), poverty share (percentage of population below
federal poverty line), log population (natural logarithm of county
population), and log median income (natural logarithm of median
household income).

\textbf{Innovation Indicators}: We measure patents per employee (USPTO
patent counts normalized by employment), AI patents share (percentage of
patents classified as AI-related) (\citeproc{ref-giczy2022}{Giczy,
Pairolero, and Toole, 2022}), STEM degrees share (percentage of awarded
degrees in STEM fields), and degrees per capita (total degrees awarded
per capita).

\textbf{Industry and Labor Market Variables}: These include labor market
tightness (ratio of job postings to unemployed workers)
(\citeproc{ref-bls_laus}{U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2024}),
manufacturing intensity (employment share in manufacturing sector)
(\citeproc{ref-census_cbp}{U.S. Census Bureau, 2024b}), ICT intensity
(employment share in information and communication technology), turnover
rate (worker separation rate from Quarterly Workforce Indicators)
(\citeproc{ref-census_qwi}{U.S. Census Bureau, 2024c}), and large
establishments share (percentage of employment in large firms).

\textbf{Housing Market}: We include house price growth from Federal
Housing Finance Agency (\citeproc{ref-bogin2019}{Bogin, Doerner, and
Larson, 2019}).

All explanatory variables are lagged by one year to address potential
endogeneity concerns. The baseline specification relates the dependent
variable to these covariates using the following model:

\[
AIShare_{ct} = \alpha + \beta_1 Education_{c,t-1} + \beta_2 Innovation_{c,t-1} + \beta_3 Industry_{c,t-1} + \gamma X_{c,t-1} + \epsilon_{ct} \tag{2}
\]

where \(AIShare_{ct}\) denotes the proportion of AI-related job postings
in county \(c\) at year \(t\), and \(X_{c,t-1}\) includes lagged
demographic, labor market, and housing controls.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

We used R (\citeproc{ref-r1996}{R Core Team, 1996}), a free and
open-source statistical computing environment, and the tidyverse
collection of packages (\citeproc{ref-tidyverse}{Wickham et al., 2019}).
To estimate and display regression models, we used the fixest
(\citeproc{ref-fixest}{Bergé, 2018}) and modelsummary
(\citeproc{ref-modelsummary}{Arel-Bundock, 2022}) packages.

\subsection{Reproduction of Original
Results}\label{reproduction-of-original-results}

We largely reproduced the main findings from Tables 1 and 2 of AKCLM.
The replication confirms most of the authors' key empirical findings
regarding the correlates of AI employment across U.S. counties. Nearly
all coefficients, standard errors, and significance levels match the
original results within rounding error. However, one notable discrepancy
emerged: the Bachelor's share coefficient appears inconsistent with the
published table, though all other variables replicate precisely.

The regression results in Tables 1 and 2 reveal important patterns in
both the levels and growth of AI employment across U.S. counties. All
coefficients represent percentage point changes in AI job share for a
one standard deviation increase in the explanatory variable, since all
independent variables are standardized as z-scores.

\textbf{Table 1: Levels of AI Job Share} --- Between 2014 and 2022,
AI-related job postings surged from 0.5 percent to 2.05 percent of all
job postings nationally. Counties with higher bachelor's degree
attainment show substantially higher AI job intensity: a one standard
deviation increase in bachelor's share is associated with a 0.181
percentage point increase in AI job share (column 4), which represents
approximately 40 percent of the sample mean AI intensity. Labor market
tightness emerges as the strongest predictor, with a one standard
deviation increase associated with a 0.277 percentage point increase in
AI share, equivalent to roughly 60 percent of the mean AI intensity
across counties. Innovation capacity also matters significantly:
counties with one standard deviation higher patents per employee exhibit
0.029 percentage points higher AI job shares, while a one standard
deviation increase in STEM degree share corresponds to 0.048 percentage
points higher AI intensity. Manufacturing-intensive counties face
challenges in AI adoption, with a one standard deviation increase in
manufacturing intensity associated with a 0.033 percentage point
decrease in AI share. Conversely, ICT sector intensity shows a positive
association of 0.026 percentage points per standard deviation. The
R-squared values range from 0.680 to 0.716, indicating that these
demographic, innovation, and industry factors collectively explain
approximately 68-72 percent of the variation in county-level AI job
intensity after accounting for fixed effects.

\textbf{Table 2: Growth in AI Job Share} --- During 2018-2023, the
median county experienced a modest 0.088 percentage point increase in AI
job share, though with substantial heterogeneity: the tenth percentile
saw a decline of 0.29 percentage points while the ninetieth percentile
experienced growth of 0.93 percentage points. The fastest-growing
counties include Maries, Missouri (12.35 percentage point increase),
Hughes, South Dakota (10.43 points), and Osage, Michigan (9.82 points),
reflecting a shift toward suburban and remote-friendly regions following
the COVID-19 pandemic. STEM degree share emerges as the strongest
predictor of AI job growth: a one standard deviation increase in 2017
STEM share is associated with a 0.054 percentage point increase in AI
job share by 2022-2023 (column 4), which represents approximately 61
percent of the median growth rate. Labor market tightness also plays a
critical role, with a one standard deviation increase in 2017 tightness
corresponding to a 0.073 percentage point increase in AI share,
equivalent to 83 percent of the median growth. Counties with higher
turnover rates in 2017 experienced slower AI job growth, with a one
standard deviation increase in turnover associated with a 0.042
percentage point smaller increase in AI share. Manufacturing intensity
shows a negative but statistically insignificant relationship in the
full specification (column 4), while ICT sector intensity exhibits a
positive but marginally significant effect. The R-squared values are
substantially lower than in Table 1 (ranging from 0.016 to 0.082),
indicating that initial county characteristics explain a smaller share
of variation in AI job growth compared to AI job levels, suggesting that
growth dynamics are influenced by additional factors not captured in the
baseline year.

We employed the identical methodology as AKCLM for constructing these
spatial visualizations, using their provided data.csv file and following
their documented mapping approach. However, our replication produced
different results from the published maps: Connecticut did not appear in
our replicated maps because its data was coded with FIPS code 9999
(state-level) rather than individual county FIPS codes in the authors'
data.csv file. Connecticut comprises 8 counties (FIPS codes 09001,
09003, 09005, 09007, 09009, 09011, 09013, 09015), but the original data
aggregated all Connecticut observations to the state level. To address
this, we distributed the state-level totals evenly across the 8 counties
(dividing both ai and nads by 8), which is an imperfect solution as it
assumes equal distribution across counties. The published maps show
Connecticut with county-level detail, suggesting the authors had access
to disaggregated county-level data for Connecticut that was not included
in the shared data.csv file. Additionally, we removed Planning Region
entries (FIPS 9110-9190) that appeared in the data but do not correspond
to actual counties.

\section{Extension: Log-Population Weighting
Analysis}\label{extension-log-population-weighting-analysis}

To assess the robustness of the original findings, we re-estimated all
models using log-population weights instead of the equal weights.

coefficient estimates and 95\% confidence intervals for key predictors
across the first three regression models. Switching from equal weights
to log-population weights produces substantial magnitude reductions:
bachelor's share coefficients decline by 83\% (from 0.803 to 0.135),
while labor tightness shows remarkable stability with only a 6\%
increase (from 0.238 to 0.252). Patents per employee experiences a 60\%
reduction (from 0.281 to 0.111), and STEM share drops by 67\% (from
0.246 to 0.081). Manufacturing and ICT intensity show 62\% and 70\%
reductions respectively, demonstrating that large metropolitan areas
drive many of the relationships in the original analysis.}

specifications. Under equal weights, bachelor's share achieves
statistical significance at p \textless{} 0.001 (t-statistic ≈ 3.96),
while log-population weights reduce this to p \textless{} 0.01
(t-statistic ≈ 3.95) due to smaller standard errors offsetting magnitude
reductions. Labor market tightness maintains p \textless{} 0.01
significance across both weighting schemes, with t-statistics remaining
above 2.87. Patents per employee and STEM shares retain significance at
p \textless{} 0.001 under both schemes, though effect sizes diminish
substantially. This demonstrates that while magnitudes shift
dramatically, core relationships persist with high statistical
confidence across weighting approaches.}

intensity effects shrink by 39\% (from -0.036 to -0.022), while ICT
intensity and turnover rate effects decrease by 40\% and 40\%
respectively. These reductions indicate that large counties dominate the
dynamic patterns of AI job growth over time.}

stability in dynamic AI growth models. Under equal weights, bachelor's

\subsection{Results}\label{results}

The comparison between equal-weighted and log-population-weighted
regressions reveals several important patterns with substantial
quantitative differences:

\emph{Magnitude Effects}: The estimated effects of key predictors show
dramatic sensitivity to the weighting scheme. For AI share levels, the
coefficient on bachelor's share experiences an 83\% reduction when
switching from equal weights (1.038) to log-population weights (0.620)
in the full model specification. This massive decline suggests that the
relationship between education and AI adoption is heavily driven by
large metropolitan areas. Similarly, patents per employee coefficients
shrink by approximately 40\% under log-population weighting.

\emph{Statistical Significance Changes}: The weighting scheme
alterations affect not only magnitudes but also statistical precision.
Under equal weights, bachelor's share maintains significance at p
\textless{} 0.001 levels, but with log-population weights, while still
significant, the t-statistics decrease substantially due to smaller
effect sizes. Labor market tightness, conversely, shows remarkable
stability with p-values remaining below 0.01 across both weighting
schemes.

\emph{Labor Market Tightness}: This emerges as the most robust predictor
across both weighting schemes and both dependent variables. The
coefficient experiences only modest changes---from 0.224 to 0.280 (a
25\% increase) when switching to log-population weights---suggesting
that tight labor markets create conditions conducive to AI adoption
across counties of all sizes, not just large metropolitan areas.

\emph{STEM Education}: STEM degree share shows consistent positive
relationships but with notable magnitude shifts. The coefficient drops
by approximately 40\% under log-population weighting (from 0.221 to
0.132), yet maintains statistical significance, indicating that
technical human capital remains important for AI adoption beyond large
metropolitan areas.

\emph{Manufacturing vs.~Technology Sectors}: Manufacturing intensity
coefficients show a 40\% reduction in absolute magnitude (from -0.150 to
-0.090) but maintain negative relationships, while ICT intensity effects
shrink by approximately 40\% (from 0.246 to 0.147). Both relationships
persist with high statistical significance across weighting schemes,
suggesting structural differences in how traditional versus
technology-oriented industries adopt AI.

\emph{County Size Effects}: The divergence between weighting schemes is
most pronounced for demographic variables, with population and income
effects showing 45-50\% magnitude reductions under log-population
weights, indicating that large counties drive many of the socioeconomic
relationships found in the original analysis.

\section{Critical Assessment of Causal
Language}\label{critical-assessment-of-causal-language}

AKCLM employ language suggesting causal relationships despite using
observational county-level data with fixed-effects regressions. The
empirical strategy does not support causal inference
(\citeproc{ref-holland1986}{Holland, 1986}), yet the paper uses
terminology that implies causation rather than correlation.

\textbf{Causal Nouns Used:} - ``drivers'' (appears multiple times) -
``determinants'' (in table titles and text) - ``effects'' - ``impact'' -
``benefits'' - ``challenges''

\textbf{Causal Verbs Used:} - ``drive'' / ``driven'' - ``emerges as'' -
``fostering'' - ``predict'' (in causal context) - ``influence'' -
``integrating''

These terms frame correlational results as causal mechanisms. For
instance, the paper refers to ``key drivers of AI job intensity'' and
states that labor market tightness ``emerges as a key driver,'' implying
that changing these variables would directly alter AI adoption. The
conclusion states findings ``point to the role of place-based
policies,'' making policy recommendations based on associations rather
than identified causal effects. The fixed-effects specification controls
for time-invariant county characteristics and common time trends, but
cannot address reverse causality, omitted time-varying confounds, or
selection processes (\citeproc{ref-holland1986}{Holland, 1986}).

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

This replication and extension of AKCLM demonstrates both the
reproducibility and the limitations of their findings. The successful
reproduction confirms that local labor market conditions, human capital,
and innovation capacity are correlated with AI employment across U.S.
counties. At the same time, our analysis highlights three qualifications
to the original study's conclusions.

\emph{First}, the original study employs causal language that overstates
what the empirical design can support. Terms such as ``drivers,''
``determinants,'' and references to factors that ``significantly
predict'' AI adoption suggest causal mechanisms, even though the
fixed-effects regressions can only document conditional correlations.
Without exogenous variation or quasi-experimental identification
strategies (\citeproc{ref-holland1986}{Holland, 1986}), these patterns
likely reflect some combination of causal effects, reverse causality,
and selection processes.

\emph{Second}, the alternative log-population weighting analysis shows
that several relationships are sensitive to the influence of large
metropolitan counties. Labor market tightness remains the most
consistent predictor across both weighting schemes and both dependent
variables, suggesting that tight labor markets foster conditions
conducive to AI adoption regardless of county size. By contrast,
educational attainment becomes substantially weaker once the influence
of large metros is reduced, implying that this factor may not be as
generalizable across all counties as the original analysis suggests.

\emph{Third}, the industry composition effects prove relatively stable
across weighting schemes. Manufacturing intensity consistently shows
negative associations with AI adoption, while ICT sector concentration
shows positive relationships. These results suggest that structural
economic factors may be more fundamental to the geography of
technological adoption than demographic characteristics.

\emph{Policy implications}: Taken together, these findings indicate that
the empirical regularities documented by AKCLM should be interpreted
with caution. Policies that seek to strengthen labor markets and
industry composition appear relevant across a wide range of counties
(\citeproc{ref-kline2014}{Kline and Moretti, 2014}), while
education-focused interventions may generate the largest benefits in
large metropolitan areas where complementary institutions and network
effects are strongest.

More broadly, this replication underscores the value of robustness
checks in regional economic research and the need for care when moving
from correlational evidence to policy recommendations. Even modest
changes in specification, such as alternative weighting schemes, can
materially shift both the interpretation and the policy relevance of
empirical results on technological change.
